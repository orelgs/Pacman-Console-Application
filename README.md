# Pacman-Console-Application
 This is a Pacman game console application created in C++, during a C++ course in The Academic College of Tel Aviv, Yaffo, 2022.
 
 This game allows you to run custom screen files you can create yourself using the file format below.
 
# Command Arguments
 The Steps and Result files are for run testing using command arguments as following: "pacman.exe - load|-save [-silent]"
 
 In the -load mode there is NO menu, it will just run the loaded game as is from the Steps file, and compare the results to the Results file!
 Can run with -silent to avoid printing to screen and just testing by the result file.
  
 In the -save mode Steps and Result files are created for each Screen file you play (So you can load them later).
 
# Screen File Format:
 
 '#' - Walls.
 
 '%' - Empty space.
 
 ' ' - Empty space to be filled with breadcrumbs.
 
 '&' - Legend location.
 
 '$' - Ghost location (May add 0 - 4 ghosts).
 
 '@' - Pacman location (Must add).
 
 Empty spaces along the walls will be tunnels - must include empty space on the other side of the wall.
 
# Steps File Format:
 
 -Each steps file will start with the line: "Colours +" / "Colours -" - indicating whether or not the game shall run with colours.
 
 -The rest of the lines will have a number - identifying which entity is about to move, following the direction:
 
 0: Pacman
 
 1: Fruit
 
 2: Ghost #1
 
 3: Ghost #2
 
 4: Ghost #3
 
 5: Ghost #4
 
 (Note: Number of ghosts may change)
 
 A: Left
 
 W: Up
 
 S: Stay
 
 X: Down
 
 D: Right
 
 -Special treatment:
 
 Fruit - When a fruit appears, the line will read: "1 S X Y VALUE", indicating the fruit appears with the direction Stay,
 its X and Y location values, and the digit value of the fruit.
 When a fruit disappears, the line will read: "1 -".
 
# Result File Format:
 
 There will be 2 possible types of lines in this file:
 
 -PacmanDeath <Time Stamp> - indicating the point of time the pacman died on this screen.
 
 -FinishedScreen <Time Stamp> - indicating the point of time the pacman finished the screen successfully.
